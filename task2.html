        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sandhya, a passionate and driven web developer with a love for crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how the web works and a desire to create impactful online experiences.

            I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and tools to enhance my skills. Whether it's designing sleek user interfaces, optimizing website performance, or building dynamic, interactive features, I enjoy every aspect of the web development process.
            
            In addition to my technical abilities, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge me to grow and expand my expertise.
            
            When I'm not coding, you can find me [mention a personal hobby or interest, e.g., "exploring the outdoors," "reading about new technologies," "working on personal side projects," etc.]. I'm also a strong advocate for [mention any causes or values you support, e.g., "inclusive design," "sustainability in tech," etc.], and I strive to incorporate these principles into my work.
            
            I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to projects that make a difference. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, share ideas, or simply chat about all things web development!</p>
